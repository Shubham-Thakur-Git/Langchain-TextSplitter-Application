The Langchain framework is designed to help developers build applications powered by language models.
It provides a variety of tools, including text splitters, to efficiently handle large documents.
With TextSplitter, you can break down documents into manageable chunks, ensuring that no token limits are exceeded.
This allows the language model to process large text in smaller, sequential parts, maintaining context and continuity.
