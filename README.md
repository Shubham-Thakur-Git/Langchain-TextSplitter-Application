### Overview
The Langchain TextSplitter Application is a tool designed to split large texts into smaller, manageable chunks, 
making it easier to process long documents with language models (LLMs) that have token limitations. 
This ensures efficient handling of text while maintaining context between chunks.


### Features
1. Chunking Large Text   : Breaks down long documents into smaller parts based on specified chunk size and overlap.
2. Customizable          : Supports character, word, or sentence-based splitting.
3. Context Preservation  : Allows overlap between chunks to maintain context for sequential processing.



### Use Cases
1. Summarization of long documents.
2. Question-answering over large texts.
3. Text pre-processing for language models.
